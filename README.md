# Training data augmentation for rumour detection using context-sensitive neural language model with large credibility corpus

## Data Collection

Data collection is performed to collect social-temporal data set on Twitter platform for rumour candidate tweets.

## Semantic Relatedness Computation

Semantic Relatedness computation is to locate various forms of rumours based on textual variations. 
ELMo based contextual-sensitive language model is employed to learn representation of tweets and 
pairwise cosine similarity are computed between reference rumour tweets and rumour candidate tweets.
